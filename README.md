# German Credit Risk Classification

## Problem Statement 

How can a Bank from Germany classify a customer with a good or bad credit risk?

## Context

Attributes and credit risk of some of the customers are given in the dataset. Task is to design a classifier which can predict whether a new customer is with good or bad credit risk to aid the bank in making decisions regarding lending credit to a customer. This will help the bank in preventing any kind of financial loss. 

## Criteria for success

The classifier should have very small errors for the test dataset.

## Scope of solution space

1000 customers and there different attributes (e.g. Age, sex, Job, credit amount etc.) are within scope of this work.

## Constraint within solution space

Missing information of some the attributes (e.g. Saving accounts, Checking accounts). It is a small dataset.

## Stakeholders

German Bank

This dataset was originally acquired by Prof Hoffman. I am planning to build a model based on logistic regression. And my final deliverable for this project will be a slide deck showing detailed analysis of the data and the steps I took to come to the final model. I will also show a comparison of my modeling result in terms of an error plot for the test data and would also be comparing this result with other models.
